## Example Input

**Subject:** Science
**Grade Level/Age Group:** 5th Grade (Ages 10-11)
**Topic:** The Water Cycle
**Lesson Duration:** 45 minutes
**Learning Objectives:** Students will be able to identify and explain the four main stages of the water cycle and describe how water moves through the environment
**Special Considerations:** Class includes 3 ELL students and 2 students with ADHD

## Example Output

### 5th Grade Science Lesson Plan: The Water Cycle

#### Lesson Overview

**Learning Objectives:**

- Students will identify the four stages of the water cycle (evaporation, condensation, precipitation, collection)
- Students will explain how water moves through each stage using scientific vocabulary
- Students will create a labeled diagram showing the water cycle process

**Lesson Summary:** Interactive exploration of the water cycle through multimedia, hands-on demonstration, and collaborative diagram creation.

**Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of states of matter (solid, liquid, gas)

### Materials and Resources

- Interactive whiteboard/projector
- Water cycle video (3 minutes)
- Clear containers, hot water, ice cubes for demonstration
- Water cycle diagram handouts
- Colored pencils/markers
- Vocabulary cards with visuals
- Digital timer

### Lesson Structure

### Opening Hook (5 minutes)

- Show dramatic time-lapse video of rain formation
- Ask: "Where does rain come from? Where does it go?"
- Record student predictions on whiteboard

### Introduction/Review (10 minutes)

- Quick review: "What are the three states of water?"
- Introduce water cycle vocabulary with visual cards
- Preview today's learning goals

### Main Activity 1: Water Cycle Demonstration (15 minutes)

- Live demonstration using hot water and ice
- Students observe and predict what happens
- Connect observation to real-world water cycle
- Introduce scientific vocabulary for each stage

### Main Activity 2: Collaborative Diagram Creation (10 minutes)

- Pairs work together to label water cycle diagram
- ELL students paired with strong English speakers
- Teacher circulates, providing targeted support

### Closure/Summary (5 minutes)

- Quick gallery walk of student diagrams
- Exit ticket: Draw one stage of the water cycle and explain it

### Teaching Strategies

**Instructional Methods:**

- Visual demonstrations and multimedia
- Collaborative learning
- Hands-on experimentation
- Graphic organizers

**Differentiation:**

- Visual vocabulary cards for ELL students
- Movement breaks for ADHD students
- Audio and visual learning components
- Flexible pairing arrangements

**Student Engagement:**

- Interactive predictions and observations
- Real-world connections
- Collaborative work opportunities

## Assessment Methods

**Formative Assessment:**

- Observation during demonstration
- Peer discussion monitoring
- Quick vocabulary checks

**Summative Assessment:**

- Labeled diagram accuracy (rubric provided)
- Exit ticket explanations
- Vocabulary usage in explanations

**Success Criteria:**

- Students can name all four stages
- Students can explain one stage in detail
- Students can identify water cycle in real scenarios

## Extension Activities

**Enrichment:**

- Research local water sources and their cycle journey
- Create water cycle comic strip
- Investigate how climate affects the water cycle

**Remediation:**

- Additional practice with vocabulary matching
- Simplified diagram with guided support
- Water cycle song or mnemonic device

**Homework:**

- Observe and record weather for one week
- Find water cycle examples around home

## Reflection Questions

- Did all students achieve the learning objectives?
- Which activities were most/least engaging?
- How effective were differentiation strategies?
- What would you modify for next time?
- How can you assess ELL student understanding more effectively?

## Variations

- **Elementary (K-2):** Simplify to basic water movement, use more songs and movements
- **Middle School:** Add detailed scientific processes, include human impact on water cycle
- **High School:** Connect to climate change, atmospheric pressure, and global water systems
- **Adult Learning:** Focus on practical applications, environmental implications

## Tips

- Use consistent visual cues throughout the lesson
- Provide sentence starters for ELL students
- Build in movement opportunities every 10-15 minutes
- Connect to local weather patterns students experience
- Use real-world examples from students' lives
