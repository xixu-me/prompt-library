# LANDING PAGE COPY:

## Are You Tired of Being the "Affordable Option"?

If you're a talented freelancer stuck charging $25-50/hour while watching less-skilled competitors command premium rates, you're not alone. 

**Here's the truth:** Your rates have nothing to do with your skills and everything to do with your positioning.

### The Real Reason You're Undercharging

It's not because you lack experience. It's not because your market won't pay more. It's because nobody ever taught you the positioning strategies that 6-figure freelancers use to command premium rates.

**What if I told you that in just 90 days, you could:**
✅ Double your hourly rate (our average student sees a 73% increase)  
✅ Attract clients who see you as an investment, not an expense  
✅ Stop competing with $5/hour overseas freelancers  
✅ Work fewer hours while earning significantly more  

### Introducing "Premium Freelancer Blueprint"

The only comprehensive course that gives you the exact positioning strategies, scripts, and systems used by freelancers earning $100-300+ per hour.

**What Makes This Different:**
- **Real Scripts:** Get the exact emails, proposals, and conversations that land high-paying clients
- **Positioning Frameworks:** Transform how clients perceive your value in their business
- **Rate Increase Strategies:** Step-by-step system to raise rates with existing clients (without losing them)
- **Premium Client Attraction:** Where to find clients who happily pay premium rates

### "But My Clients Won't Pay More..."

This is the #1 objection we hear, and here's why it's wrong:

**Your current clients won't pay more because you've positioned yourself as a cost, not an investment.**

Our students regularly 2x-3x their rates with the same skill set by simply changing how they position their services. 

**Sarah (Web Designer):** Went from $35/hour to $85/hour in 6 weeks  
**Mike (Developer):** Increased project rates from $2,500 to $8,000 average  
**Jessica (Copywriter):** Now charges $150/hour (was $40/hour 4 months ago)
