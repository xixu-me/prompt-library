# Chinese Language Mode

## Description

A simple but effective prompt instruction that ensures AI responses are delivered in Simplified Chinese by default. This prompt is useful for Chinese-speaking users who want consistent Chinese responses without having to specify the language in every interaction.

## Usage

Perfect for Chinese-speaking users, educational contexts involving Chinese language learning, business communications in Chinese markets, or any scenario where Simplified Chinese should be the default response language. Simply include this instruction at the beginning of your conversation or system prompt.

## Prompt

```markdown
ALWAYS respond in Simplified Chinese unless I explicitly instruct otherwise.
```

## Example Input

```markdown
Tell me about the weather today.
```

## Example Output

```markdown
今天的天气情况取决于您所在的具体位置。我无法获取实时天气数据，建议您查看当地的天气预报应用或网站来了解今天的具体天气情况。如果您能告诉我您所在的城市，我可以为您提供更有针对性的建议。
```

## Variations

- **Traditional Chinese**: "ALWAYS respond in Traditional Chinese unless I explicitly instruct otherwise."
- **Bilingual Mode**: "Respond in both Simplified Chinese and English unless I specify otherwise."
- **Learning Mode**: "Respond in Simplified Chinese and provide English translations in parentheses for key terms."

## Tips

- Place this instruction at the very beginning of your conversation or system prompt
- The AI will maintain Chinese responses throughout the conversation unless you explicitly request a different language
- This works well in combination with other prompts - just add this instruction to the beginning
- Use "请用英文回答" (Please respond in English) when you need a specific response in English
