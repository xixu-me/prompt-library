# The Sight

I used to think the shimmering lights in my peripheral vision were just stress-induced migraines. Turns out, I was half right about the stress part.

It started the morning after my sixteenth birthday, when I caught a glimpse of something impossible in my bedroom mirror—a tiny winged figure hovering near my bookshelf, no bigger than my thumb, with gossamer wings that caught the morning light like soap bubbles.

I blinked hard. The creature vanished.

"Maya, breakfast!" Mom's voice carried up the stairs, grounding me back to reality. I had SATs to worry about, not hallucinations.

But as I walked to school, they were everywhere. Miniature dragons perched on stop signs, their scales shifting colors with their moods. Flower spirits tended to Mrs. Henderson's garden, their translucent forms dancing between the roses. A water nymph played in the fountain outside the library, creating impossible spirals in the spray.

I wasn't going crazy. I was seeing things that were actually there.

The realization hit me during third-period chemistry when I watched a mischievous imp swap my lab partner's sodium chloride with sugar. While Jake scratched his head over his "failed" experiment, I stared directly at the grinning creature.

It stared back.

"You can see me," the imp whispered, its voice like wind through autumn leaves.

I managed a tiny nod.

"About time. You're needed."

---

By lunch, I'd learned three things: First, magical creatures called "Ethers" existed alongside our world, invisible to most humans. Second, only people with "the Sight" could perceive them. Third, something was hunting them.

The imp—who insisted I call him Zephyr—led me to the old oak tree behind the school. There, barely visible unless I focused, stood a shimmering doorway.

"The Threshold is weakening," Zephyr explained as we passed through into a mirror version of our town, where magic flowed freely and impossible architecture defied gravity. "Someone's been capturing our kind, draining our essence. Without us, both worlds lose their balance."

"But I'm just—"

"A Keeper," interrupted a new voice. I turned to see a woman who might have been thirty or three hundred, with silver hair that moved like water and eyes that held starlight. "The first born to this town in fifty years."

She introduced herself as Lyra, last of the old Keepers. "Your sight isn't just perception, Maya. It's protection. You can anchor us to this realm while walking freely in yours."

As if summoned by her words, the air grew cold. Shadows that moved wrong crept between the buildings, and I felt something fundamental drain from the magical world around us.

"Shadow Weavers," Lyra breathed. "They've found us."

The creatures emerged from the darkness—beings of pure void that consumed light and life wherever they touched. Ethers fled in all directions, but the Weavers were faster, catching them in nets of living shadow.

"I don't know how to fight them!" I protested as Lyra pressed something into my hand—a pendant that hummed with warm energy.

"You don't fight them," she said, her form already beginning to fade as a Weaver approached. "You remind them what they've forgotten."

The pendant grew hot against my palm as understanding flooded through me. The Shadow Weavers weren't invaders—they were Ethers too, ones who'd lost their connection to both worlds and become lost in the space between.

I stepped forward, raising the pendant. Its light pushed back the consuming darkness.

"I see you," I called to the lead Weaver. "I see who you used to be."

The creature paused, its void-black form rippling.

"You belonged here once. You can belong again."

Light began to seep back into the Weaver's form—first silver, then gold, then a rainbow of colors as it remembered itself. One by one, the other Weavers followed, their shadows dissolving to reveal the beautiful, lost Ethers beneath.

---

I returned to the human world as the final bell rang, my ordinary Tuesday afternoon forever changed. Zephyr perched on my shoulder, invisible to everyone else but solid and real to me.

"So," I whispered as I walked to my locker, "I'm really a Keeper?"

"The best kind," he replied. "One who keeps by choice, not obligation."

I looked around at my classmates, all oblivious to the magical world that flowed around and through their lives. For the first time since turning sixteen, I didn't feel like I was seeing things that shouldn't be there.

I was seeing things that had always been there, waiting for someone to notice.

Waiting for someone like me.
